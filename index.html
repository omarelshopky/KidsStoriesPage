          <h2 class="story-title">THE GUARDIANS OF LORE</h2>

          <p class="story-txt">
             With Ream on their tail, the trio must unearth a powerful tool protected by riddles and rile (the magic that fuels
            nightmares) to save the fate of all fairytales past. But, before Cal can defeat Ream, he has to
            deal with Soy's knack for arguing with magical creatures, discover the truth about Deli's 
            identity, and earn his place as the hero of the story. The Guardians of Lore is a middle grade
            novel that centers around two life-long friends, infusing humor and fantasy-based riddles into
            a modern fairytale.
